# strategy_game

This is a turn-based strategy game that is designed for two players using the same browser. Many would assume that it is a is reminiscent of chess after playing it a little while. However, anyone familiar with games like the Civilization would probably recognize that that series (and, specifically, how its battles are carried out) was my real inspiration for this program. There is a lot still to be done (as of now, 19 APR 2018), but I am proud that a two-player game can successfully begin and end without any (noticed) bugs.
